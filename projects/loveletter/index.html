    Games on the Cartoon Network and Disney Channel websites used to basically consume my life. I would run home to play them so I could optimize my time before my parents came home and I had to pretend to do homework. Sandwich Stacker on Disney was one of my personal favorites. The game is simple. You scroll left and right to move 625 and catch the good ingredients, avoiding the bad to build a sandwich tower.
