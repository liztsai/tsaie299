    <p> The Oxen </p>
    </font>

    <p>Christmas Eve, and twelve of the clock.</p>
    <p>“Now they are all on their knees,”</p>
    <p>An elder said as we sat in a flock</p>
    <p>By the embers in hearthside ease.</p>
    <p>We pictured the meek mild creatures where</p>
    <p>They dwelt in their strawy pen,</p>
    <p>Nor did it occur to one of us there</p>
    <p>To doubt they were kneeling then.</p>
    <p> So fair a fancy few would weave </p>
    <p> In these years! Yet, I feel, </p>
    <p> If someone said on Christmas Eve, </p>
    <p> “Come; see the oxen kneel, </p>
    <p> “In the lonely barton by yonder coomb </p>
    <p> Our childhood used to know,” </p>
    <p> I should go with him in the gloom, </p>
    <p> Hoping it might be so. </p>
